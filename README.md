#### {this program is ment to determine different types of triangles from Isosceles, equilateral, and scalene, and the program checks a number properties that make or form a triangle. }, {3rd June, 2019}
#### Author  **{Charles Onkoba}**
## Description
{This is a program that checks all sides of a triangle to make sure that the sides meet the required triangle properties; for example equilateral triangle with equal sides should give the output as same as the triangle itself  }
