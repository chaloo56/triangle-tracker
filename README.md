## Description
{This is a program that checks all sides of a triangle to make sure that the sides meet the required triangle properties; for example equilateral triangle with equal sides should give the output as same as the triangle itself  }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* git clone url: https://github.com/chaloo56/triangle-tracker.git
* cd my triangle-tracker
* open index.html from a browser

### BDD

 
when you input values that are not equal to each other the program will display scalene

when you key in equal values of sides of the triangle the program will display an equilateral triangle example 
when you key in values and two sides are equal that is basically an isosceles triangle 
when you key in values that have 0 and less the program will not work
when two sides of a triangle added together and are less than one the program wont run as required
